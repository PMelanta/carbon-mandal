title: Why Sustainability?
description: Finite Planet. Infinite Ambitions. Failing Solutions.
background: ''

 <p>
    The exponential economic growth we have witnessed in the last few decades is banked by the belief that resources are infinite. And when the resources decline, scientists and inventors will have the next idea or gadget ready to replace it. Although this was true, we have reached a saturation level. It's about time we think of solutions that not only add to the economy but also aid in sustaining the planet and its resources. After all, we have only one planet. There is no alternative.
 </p>
<p>
   According to Global footprint network, we are using Earth's annual resources at a faster rate than it can regenerate. The unprecedented needs of 7.8 billion people have created an ecological imbalance leading to the destruction of the planet. This is threatening the very survival of the human species.
</p>
<p>
   We are in the zenith of human civilization. We have mapped the seven seas and extended our knowledge to the realms of the universe. We have achieved untold technological developments, yet, we are failing the only home we can survive on.
</p>
   <p>
      Imagine living in a world with overflowing landfills, polluted air and water, extreme weather conditions, acute food shortage, burdened with inequitable distribution of wealth and resources. Not a pleasant sight to behold, right!?
   </p>
    <p>
    Now it's no longer the about the planet, it's about ourselves, it's about saving the human species. Global warming, climate change is real. It may not be happening right in front of your eyes, but its consequences are evident.

<h3>The Waves of Change</h3>

<p>
    In the past decade or so, global warming and its repercussions have been in the spotlight due to various campaigns and protests. Although this issue needs more attention, it has nevertheless created a gradual awareness in the masses, resulting in a steady, albeit slow change in the consuming pattern of humans. People are now conscious of their choices and try to use and associate themselves with products and brands which are sustainable, eco-friendly and cruelty- free.
</p>
<p>
    The rise in environmental sentiment led to the UN's Paris Climate Agreement—a dedication to keep the Earth's temperature below 2 degree Celsius. In addition to strict government policies and laws for better environmental protection and pollution prevention. Many nations around the world today have policies and action plans in place to meet the need of the hour. Slowly developing countries are taking the cue to do the same. Its lesson 101 from Darwin's theory of evolution—the future belongs to those who can change and sustain.

<h3>
    The Path towards Sustainability
</h3>

<p>
    It's a misassumption that Sustainability comes at the cost of profit or forgoing human needs. Effective sustainability management merges the economy and environment in such a way that it doesn't hinder the progression of the present and future generations.
</p>
<p>
    Brundtland report defines Sustainable development as "A development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." One cannot plan for any development if one doesn't have the resources or money for it. Therefore, we have to aim for an effective, economical package with a positive ecological and social impact.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, people, although with honest intention, do more harm than good when they try to venture to save the environment without any prior research or understanding. To restore the ecological balance, one has to study and understand the ecosystem, the cause and effects of the imbalance, geopolitical factors, scientific factors, and economic factors.
</p>
<p>
    The question shouldn't be why Sustainability, it should be why not!
</p>
<p>
    For successful sustainability development, one needs people who specialize in sustainable development and management. It's elementary!
